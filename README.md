# Premium Price Prediction using Machine Learning Model
# Overview
This project aims to predict premium prices for a certain product or service using machine learning techniques. Premium price prediction is crucial for businesses to optimize pricing strategies and maximize revenue. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms, this project offers a predictive model to estimate premium prices accurately.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Model Training: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as regression, ensemble methods, or neural networks to train predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), or R-squared.
Prediction: Allows users to input relevant features and obtain predicted premium prices.
